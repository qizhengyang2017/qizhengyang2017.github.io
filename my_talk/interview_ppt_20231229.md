# Background

- Cotton contains 45 diploids and 7 allopolyploids (AD)
- 4 species were domesticated as cultivars (A1, A2, AD1 and AD2)

![w:1000 center](./figs/image11.png)

---
# Questions

1. What genetic factors influence the fiber quality of upland cotton? 
2. Why only A genome has spinnable fibers in diploids?
3. Why allotetraploids have better fiber quality than diploids?

# Project 1

![w:900 center](./figs/cb_title.png)

I performed data analysis and wrote the manuscript.

---

# Main results

1. Performed two complementary GWAS method
2. Detect prevalent epistatic interactions

---

# What I have learnt

The main approaches for studying complex traits
- GWAS and linkage mapping
- IBD inference
- heritability
- epistasis

![bg right:40% w:300](./figs/book.jpg)

# Project 2

![w:1000 center](./figs/ng_title.png)

Contribution: 1/3 analysis tasks (figs5,6)

---

# Experimental design

- Re-sequence 216 diploid cotton accessions
- RNA-seq for 5 time-points for each accession
- Perform GWAS and eQTL analysis

![h:300 center](./figs/diploid_design.png)

---

# Why perform eQTL analysis?


- Provide a reliable molecular link between DNA variants and complex phenotypes
- Prioritize causal genes at GWAS loci 
![bg right:40% h:500](./figs/image19.png)

---

# Networking of genes

- A regulatory hotspot overlapped with a GWAS locus of FL
- The 52 genes regulated by the hotspot were involved in the processes of plant-type cell wall organization and protein transport

---

# Why A genome has spinnable fibers?

- Performed syntenic analysis of 195 putative functional genes
- The left figure serves as an example, illustrating the PAV of two tandem duplication genes was associated with fiber evolution

---

# Project 3

![w:1000 center](./figs/ng_title2.png)

Contribution: 1/3 analysis tasks (part of figs.2,3, and entire fig.6)

---

# GWAS and TWAS analysis

![w:800 center](./figs/tetraploid_twas.png)

- Conducted GWAS of fiber quality and found 18 QTLs
- Performed TWAS and found 1255 genes associated with fiber quality


---

# Cotton breeding strategy

![w:800 center](./figs/tetraploid_breeding.png)

- We can further improve fiber quality by targeting one of the less favourably expressed gene in the homologous gene pairs.

---
# What I have learnt

Post-GWAS analysis
- Prioritization of variants in the non-coding regions
- Construction of GS model

---

# Two more projects

- Domestication/breeding history of upland cotton
- Pan-genome analysis of 75 accessions (15 diploids and 60 tetraploids)

![bg right:45% w:500](./figs/3D_pca.png)

---

# Summary

- I know many details about quantitative genetics.
- I am good at bioinformtics workflow construction and downstream analysis.

---

# Future research interests

- Understand the evolution of interesting phenotypes by employing a state-of-the art multi-omics approach
- Deciper the genetics basis of key agronomic traits by using statistical genetics and functional case-studies
